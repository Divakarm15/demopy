# requirements.txt
# This program uses ONLY Python's built-in standard library
# No external packages are required!

# Built-in modules used:
# - random
# - time
# - sys
# - io (for StringIO in tests)
# - unittest (for testing)

# Therefore: ZERO dependencies to install

# You can run this program on any Python 3.6+ installation with nothing to pip install

# Optional: If you want to generate a coverage report later:
# coverage.py>=7.0
