# requirements.txt
# Tic-Tac-Toe (XO Game) - No external dependencies required

# All modules used in the program are part of Python's standard library:
# - tkinter      → included with Python
# - random       → built-in
# - time         → built-in
# - winsound     → built-in on Windows (ignored on Linux/macOS)

# Therefore, no third-party packages need to be installed.

# OPTIONAL: If you want sound on Linux/macOS in the future, uncomment one of these:
# pygame==2.6.1
# playsound==1.3.0

# For now: ZERO external packages → fastest & safest
